A program stores a contact list of telephone numbers. Each telephone number is stored as a string of six or
more numeric characters.
Before they are displayed, number strings are formatted to make them easier to read. This involves forming
the characters into groups, separated by the space character.
The maximum length of a number group is five characters.
Different numbers may have different groupings. A template string is used to define the grouping. 

For Example:
String                 Template        Formatted String
"01223553998"          "53"            "01223 553 998"

For the first row, template "53" results in a formatted string comprising:
• the first five characters in the first group
• a space character
• the next three characters in the second group
• a space character
• the remaining characters from the number string.


(a) Write pseudocode for a function GroupNum(), which takes a telephone number and a template as
parameter strings and returns a formatted string.
You may assume that the template and telephone number are valid.

Module Program
    Function GroupNum(mystr, template)
        Dim finalstr, old_str, group As String
        Dim i, curr_len As Integer
        finalstr = ""
        old_str = mystr

        For i = 1 To Len(template)
            curr_len = Mid(template, i, 1)
            group = Mid(old_str, 1, curr_len) & " "
            finalstr += group
            old_str = Mid(old_str, curr_len + 1, Len(old_str) - 1)
        Next

        If Len(old_str) <> 0 Then
            finalstr += old_str
        End If

        Return finalstr
    End Function


    Sub Main()
        Console.WriteLine(GroupNum("03112593164", "4322"))
        Console.WriteLine(GroupNum("4044496128", "33"))
        Console.WriteLine(GroupNum("509700101", "222"))
    End Sub
End Module
