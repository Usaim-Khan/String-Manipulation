Programming languages provide built-in functions to generate random numbers.
To be truly random, the frequency of each number generated should be the same.
You are required to write program code to test the random number generator of your chosen
language.

The test should:
•	 generate a given number of random numbers between 1 and 10 inclusive
•	 keep a count of the number of times each number is generated
•	 calculate the expected frequency of each number 1 to 10
•	 output the actual frequency of each number 1 to 10
•	 output the difference between the actual frequency and the expected frequency.
The program code should be written as a procedure. In pseudocode, the procedure heading will be:
 PROCEDURE TestRandom(Repetitions AS INTEGER)

The parameter, Repetitions, contains a value representing the total number of random numbers
that should be generated.
The following example shows the expected output for the procedure call, TestRandom(200).

The expected frequency is 20.

Number   Frequency     Difference
1        17               −3
2        21                1
3        12               −8
4        28                8
5        20                0
6        19               −1
7        21                1
8        16               −4
9        24                4
10       22                2

Module Program
    Sub TestRandom(repetitions)
        Dim myarr(0 To 9) As Integer
        Dim i, randnum As Integer
        Dim freq As Double
        Dim random As New Random
        freq = repetitions / 10

        For i = 0 To 9
            myarr(i) = 0
        Next
        For i = 1 To repetitions
            randnum = random.Next(1, 11)
            myarr(randnum - 1) = myarr(randnum - 1) + 1
        Next
        Console.WriteLine("Expected Frequency: " & freq)
        Console.WriteLine("Number           Frequency           Difference")
        For i = 1 To 10
            Console.WriteLine(i & "                    " & myarr(i - 1) & "                   " & myarr(i - 1) - freq)

            'Console.WriteLine("Number: " & i)
            'Console.WriteLine("Frequency: " & myarr(i - 1))
            'Console.WriteLine("Difference: " & myarr(i - 1) - freq)
        Next


    End Sub
    Sub Main()
        TestRandom(50)
        TestRandom(80)
        TestRandom(200)
        TestRandom(800)
